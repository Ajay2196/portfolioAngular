                The FarmWise is a project that has been modelled keeping in mind the strong pillars of sustainability,
                reliability and transformation – that is, an application aimed to provide sustainability in the way the
                business is carried out, reliability of the platform being used to carry it out and transforming small
                businesses digitally eventually impacting lives at different points in the supply chain.
                <li class="pt-2">
                    FarmWise resulted as a group conversation when the discussion was initiated
                    around the concept of connecting a local producer to the end customer. It piqued our (designers)
                    curiosity when we started discussing how "wise” it would be if the producer knew how
                    much to grow based on the demand for the produce from their “farm” and hence the
                    name came to being for this application as “FarmWise”

                    Following this, semi-structured interviews with some of the canidates that were recruited from the
                    university's postgraduate cohort were carried out, to understand the means to socializing in the
                    campus and identify a problem space, if any.
                </p>

                <p class="description">
                    It was found out that 3 out of 5 students who are new to the campus hesitate to socialize as they
                    fear that they might not have the common interests to socialize with other campus members.
                    Further, a mechanism to connect people with common interests was missing as the clubs and societies
                    at that point were not fully functioning as it was the first time the campus had reopened for
                    classes after Covid-19
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                    A consensus was hence arrived at, to design an application that would enable people to connect upon
                    matching their interests or would let them explore new interests and find buddies doing so.

            <p class="description">
                This phase deals majorly with the evaluation of the UI design by carrying out the co-operative
                evaluation with the users, where they would test the usability of the low-fidelity prototype.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                The technique that was fitting the requirement well, was found out to be summative evaluation. Usability
                tests were conducted along the guidelines of cognitive walkthrough, walkthrough with thinking aloud and
                cooperative evaluation, where the tasks had been laid out for the users to test that consisted of one
                major vertical task and 3 smaller feature tasks.

                There were <b>5</b> participants that were recruited. The background of these participants was majorly
                postgraduate students studying at University of Limerick, in different disciplines.
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                The recruited participants were briefed about the activity and the process when they were approached in
                order to obtain their informed consent
            </p>

            <p class="description">
                The participants were informed that they could leave at any point they felt uncomfortable during the
                usability testing session and the information they have shared would be kept confidential.

                The following feedback points were found to be crucial and were the taken as the requirements for the
                re-designing of the application based on the feedback during the evaluation stage:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Back navigation was missing in the application</li>
                <li>Picking Interest screen to be re-designed to enable the user to search and add the desired interest
                    rather than add from a set of interests that are available</li>
                <li>“What if the user adds all the interests?” - the major bug that needed to be looked into.</li>
                <li>How to resolve privacy concerns?</li>
                <li>Adding a block/mute feature to avoid potential harassment on the platform</li>
                <li>As a minor enhancement, an app landing screen was envisioned that gives the option to login and sign
                    up</li>
